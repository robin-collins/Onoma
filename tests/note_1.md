## Completed Tasks
- Refactored CLI logic into a `main(args)` function in `src/onomatool/cli.py` for improved testability and direct invocation from tests.
- Updated argument parsing in `cli.py` to support all required options, including `--config`, `--dry-run`, `--interactive`, and `--debug`. Verified help output matches project requirements.
- Integrated TOML config loader with CLI, ensuring that alternate config files can be specified and loaded correctly. Added support for environment variable overrides.
- Added initial error handling and logging to `cli.py` and `llm_integration.py`, including human-readable error messages for missing arguments and invalid config files.
- Wrote basic tests for CLI argument parsing and config loading in `tests/test_usage_enduser.py`. Tests now cover default config, alternate config, dry-run, and interactive modes.
- Collaborated with Carol to review and merge the initial test suite for CLI usage scenarios. Discussed edge cases and future test expansion.
- Participated in code review for Dave's file dispatcher module (`file_dispatcher.py`); provided feedback on modularity, error handling, and extensibility for new file types.
- Updated project documentation to reflect new CLI options, config structure, and usage examples. Added a section on troubleshooting common errors.
- Synced with Frank to ensure CI pipeline runs all new tests and checks for config compatibility. Verified that all tests pass in CI and on local dev machines.
- Attended daily standup and shared progress on CLI refactor and test coverage.

## In Progress
- Implementing LLM integration in `llm_integration.py` with support for mock provider and config-driven selection. Working on passing config through all layers.
- Drafting additional test cases for file renaming scenarios, including edge cases (conflicts, invalid files, permission errors, non-UTF-8 files).
- Reviewing requirements for image and PDF file support; prototyping SVG-to-PNG conversion using CairoSVG and Pillow. Coordinating with Dave on image processing utilities.
- Working with Eve to gather user feedback on CLI usability, help output, and error messages. Preparing a user survey for beta testers.
- Refactoring prompt management to allow for user-defined system, user, and image prompts via config. Updating `prompts.py` and related tests.
- Coordinating with Alice to finalize the architecture diagram for the project wiki. Reviewing draft diagrams and providing feedback.
- Reviewing PRs from Carol and Dave for test enhancements and file processing improvements.

## Blockers
- Awaiting feedback from Carol on the config schema and test coverage for edge cases. Need confirmation on required and optional fields.
- Need clarification from Alice on expected output format for image-based renaming (should extension always be preserved? Should we allow user-defined output templates?).
- Encountered intermittent issues with TOML parsing when loading malformed config files; investigating error handling improvements and adding more robust validation.
- Limited test coverage for non-UTF-8 files; need sample files for further testing. Reached out to Frank for help generating test cases.
- Some confusion over how to handle batch renaming when conflicts occur; proposed adding a conflict resolution strategy to the config.

## Next Steps
- Finalize LLM integration and mock provider logic in `llm_integration.py`. Ensure all tests pass with both real and mock providers.
- Expand test coverage for batch processing, recursive directory traversal, and dry-run/interactive modes. Add tests for new edge cases identified in code review.
- Begin work on documentation for CLI usage, configuration, troubleshooting, and advanced features. Draft a quickstart guide for new users.
- Schedule a meeting with Eve and Carol to review user feedback and update help output. Prepare a summary of survey results for the team.
- Prepare a demo for the next team meeting showcasing the new CLI features, testability improvements, and user feedback integration.
- Review and merge outstanding PRs for file dispatcher and prompt management.

## Notes
- Team meeting scheduled for 2024-06-18 to review progress on CLI, config, and LLM integration. Agenda includes demo, feedback review, and planning for next sprint.
- No major issues encountered; development is on track for the current milestone. All team members are actively contributing and collaborating.
- Code reviews have been productive; team is collaborating well on shared modules. Noted improvement in code quality and documentation.
- CI pipeline is now running all tests on push and PR; thanks to Frank for the setup. All tests passing as of this morning.
- Carol suggested adding a section to the docs on how to contribute new file processors and naming conventions.
- Dave is preparing a benchmark of image conversion performance for large PDF and SVG files.

## Lessons Learned
- Refactoring CLI logic into a callable function greatly improved testability and reduced test flakiness. Tests now run faster and are easier to debug.
- Early integration of config-driven design made it easier to support alternate providers and test scenarios. Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability.
- Collaboration between dev, QA, and DevOps has accelerated progress and improved code quality. Regular code reviews and pair programming sessions have been valuable.
- Clear documentation and code comments have helped onboard new contributors quickly. New team members were able to submit PRs within their first week.
- Proactive communication about blockers and dependencies has minimized delays. Daily standups and async updates have kept everyone aligned.
- Adding a mock provider early enabled reliable CI and reproducible test results, even when LLM APIs are unavailable.
